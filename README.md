Postmark
===================

A (minor) modification to [KeystoneJS](http://keystonejs.com/) to add a few custom APIs for:

* Populating a connected MongoDB with retail stores (e.g. Macy's or BestBuy) and their addresses, geocoordinates, storeId and more
* A basic geofencing API (to be used from mobile devices) that when sending a lat/long pair determines:
    - If the request location is NEAR any stores (as a teaser)
    - If the request is IN any store (to unlock a special offer)
